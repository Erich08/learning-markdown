## What does REST stand for?

- Representational State Transfer

## REST APIs are designed around a \_\_\_\_.

> REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

## What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.

> A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:

[https://adventure-works.com/orders/1](https://adventure-works.com/orders/1)

## What are the most common HTTP verbs?

> Get, Post, Put, Patch, Delete

## What should the URIs be based on?

> Adopt a consistent naming convention in URIs. In general, it helps to use plural nouns for URIs that reference collections. It's a good practice to organize URIs for collections and items into a hierarchy. For example, /customers is the path to the customers collection, and /customers/5 is the path to the customer with ID equal to 5. This approach helps to keep the web API intuitive. Also, many web API frameworks can route requests based on parameterized URI paths, so you could define a route for the path /customers/{id}.

## Give an example of a good URI.

## What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

> Another factor is that all web requests impose a load on the web server. The more requests, the bigger the load. Therefore, try to avoid "chatty" web APIs that expose a large number of small resources. Such an API may require a client application to send multiple requests to find all of the data that it requires. Instead, you might want to denormalize the data and combine related information into bigger resources that can be retrieved with a single request. However, you need to balance this approach against the overhead of fetching data that the client doesn't need. Retrieving large objects can increase the latency of a request and incur additional bandwidth costs. For more information about these performance antipatterns, see Chatty I/O and Extraneous Fetching.

## What status code does a successful `GET` request return?

> A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK).

## What status code does an unsuccessful `GET` request return?

> If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

## What status code does a successful `POST` request return?

> If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created). The URI of the new resource is included in the Location header of the response. The response body contains a representation of the resource.

## What status code does a successful `DELETE` request return?

> If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content), indicating that the process has been successfully handled, but that the response body contains no further information. If the resource doesn't exist, the web server can return HTTP 404 (Not Found).
