# D & I

## What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

- Personal computers started becoming more prevalent in house holds.

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

- I am really not sure. Perhaps a larger proportion of males were interested in computers relative to females. I don't believe you can pin point this to one specific cause. It is most certaintly more complicated and nuanced.
