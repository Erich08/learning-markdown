# Status Codes Based On REST Methods

## In your own words, describe what each grou of status code represents:

1. 100's = Everything is working ok so far.
2. 200's = Success!
3. 300's = There are more than a single response.
4. 400's = There is some sort of server issue, something that cannot be found.
5. 500's = There is some sort of error on the backend.

## What is status code 202?

> Often used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future. The response body should include an URL to the finished resource with some information about when it will be available, or an URL to some monitoring endpoint that tells the client when the resource is available.

## What is status code 308?

> This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. It’s helpful when we have multiple endpoints for one resource, but don’t want to implement reading from all of them.

## What code would you use if an udate didn't return data to a client?

> 204 No Content - A proper code for updates that don’t return data to the client, for example when just saving a currently edited document.

## What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longers does?

> 401 Gone - This is like 404 but we know that the resource existed in the past, but it got deleted or somehow moved, and we don’t know where.

## What is the 'Forbidden' status code?

> 403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.
