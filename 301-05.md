# React Docs - Thinking in React

## What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

> But how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

## What does it mean to build a 'static' version of your aplication?

> Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. _The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity_. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why.

## Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

> To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with _state_.

## What are three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.

2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.

3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

## How can you identify where state needs to live?

For each piece of state in your application:

- Identify every component that renders something based on that state.

- Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

- Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

- If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

# Higher-Order Functions

## What is a "higher-order function"?

> Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions. Since we have already seen that functions are regular values, there is nothing particularly remarkable about the fact that such functions exist. The term comes from mathematics, where the distinction between functions and other values is taken more seriously.

## Explore the _greaterThan_ function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

To me, it seems as if it is creating a new function that ultimate evaluates to true once console.logged. And of course, the reading says that more or less.

## Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions?

> The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values. The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its content will have been mapped to a new form by the function.
