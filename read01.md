# What is Markdown anyway?
Per GitHub: "Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown."

## Markdown Syntax

There are a multitude of things you can do utilizing Markdown syntax. One example is an unordered list by typing in "* (text here)" such as this:

* This is an undordered list
* This is still an unordered list
  * We can indent the unordered list
  * The unordered list in still indented

If we wanted to add _emphasis_ to text we would use either  _ _ or * *  with whatever text you prefer in between. 

Have an inspirational quote you would like to add? Markdown can do that as well. Here is an example:
> "Surround yourself with those who like big butts, they cannot lie and you will never have to question their trustworthiness."
> -Sir Mix-a-lot (maybe)

You would like to be able to link a webpage or website you say? Markdown can do that as well. And for your convenience I will be linking the [Markdown Syntax Reference](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) page here.

## Conclusion

Markdown is a very simple, but _effective_, syntax to use. Let's take a look at some pros and cons:
