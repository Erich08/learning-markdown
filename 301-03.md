# Lists and Keys

1. What does .map() return ?

    * An array

2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

    * > You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

3. Each list item needs a unique ....?

    * Each list items need a unique ID.

4. What is the purpose of a key.

    * > A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.
    * > Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

# The Spread Operator

1. What is the spread operator?

    * > The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

2. List four things the spread operator can do.

   * Copying an array
   * Concatenating or combining arrays
   * Using Math functions
   * Using an array as arguments
   * Adding an item to a list
   * Adding to state in React
   * Combining objects
   * Converting NodeList to an array

3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
```
    [...["😋😛😜🤪😝"]] // Array [ "😋😛😜🤪😝" ]
    [..."🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!"] // Array(9) [ "🙂", "🙃", "😉", "😊", "😇", "🥰", "😍", "🤩", "!" ]

    const hello = {hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝"}
    const world = {world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!"}

    const helloWorld = {...hello,...world}
    console.log(helloWorld) // Object { hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝", world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!" }
```

4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
```

5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one. 

```
const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍

```
