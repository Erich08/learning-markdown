## Who is Roy Fielding?

> He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

> That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

> Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

## What does `get` do?

> So anyway, HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

> It is. Especially when you're using a web browser because browsers pretty much just GET stuff. They don't do a lot of other types of interaction with resources. This is a problem because it has led many people to assume that HTTP is just for GET'ing. But HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.

## what does `post` do?

> Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET.

## What does `put` do?

If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT

## What does `patch` do?

> ...to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.
