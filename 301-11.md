## SQL vs NoSQL

| SQL | NoSQL |
| ---- | ---- |
| SQL databases are primarily called as relational databases | NoSQL databases are called as non-relational databases |
| SQL databases are are tabled based | NoSQL databases are document based |
| SQL databases have predefined schema | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable |
| SQL databases are good for complex queries | NoSQL databases are good for simple queries | 

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

> SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

## Give a real world example

> SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

## What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?

> NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). 

## Give a real world example

> Hbase is an example for this purpose.

## What database is better for heirarachical data?

> NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data)

## Which type of database is better for scalability?

> For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
