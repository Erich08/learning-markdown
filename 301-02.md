# 301 Reading Assignment 2

## React Lifecycle

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

According to the diagram found [here](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093) render comes before componentDidMount.

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

**Mounting** occurs first.

> When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates.

   - constructor
   - render
   - React Updates
   - componentDidMount
   - componentWillUnmount

4. What does componentDidMount do?

   - This is the final phase of the React lifecycle when if called a component is being removed from the DOM.

## State and Props

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?

   - According to Kyle at WDS, you can think of props as _arguments_ you would pass into a function.

2. What is the big difference between props and state?

   - Props are passed into a component while state is handled within the component.

3. When do we re-render our application?

   - The application is re-rendered when we change the state within a component.

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

   - User input and numbers.
