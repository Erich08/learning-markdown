# Images

> You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

HTML example:

```
<img src="images/magnolia-large.jpg" class="large" alt="Magnolia">
```

CSS Example: 

```
img.large {
    width: 500px;
    height: 500px;
}
```

> First you need to determine the sizes of images that will be used commonly throughout the site, then give each size a name.

Name/class examples:

* Small
* Medium
* Large

How to center an img using CSS:

```
img.align-center {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

You can also make an image a background by using this CSS property:

```
body {
    background-image: url("img URL");
}
```

You can also make the background image repeat or not repeat using the following code:

```
body {
    background-image: repeat;
}

OR

body {
    background-image: no-repeat;
}
```

I have a little experience with SEO. My wife and I had an Etsy shop for about 8 months last year. She made soy wax candles and I handled the shop. We had a limited amount of keywords per listing and you had to ensure that they were effective keywords to ensure the visibility of your page. I used a program called Marmalead that I would do research on the keywords and see how popular they were. This particular company took data from searches on Etsy itself by users so it was a pretty effective tool to utilize. SEO can make or break your shop whenever the item your are producing is also made by hundreds of other shops. You could have a really great product, product photos, and product descriptions, but SEO could make or break your shop.
